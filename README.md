# mailstrip

mailstrip is a [Go][2] library that parses email text and strips it of
signatures and reply quotes. It is a port of [email\_reply\_parser][1], GitHub's
library for parsing email replies.

## Differences to email_reply_parser

Most of mailstrip is a line-by-line port of email\_reply\_parser and it passes
all tests from the email\_reply\_parser test suite. However, it also implements
a few improvements that are not part of email\_reply\_parser:

* Forwarded fragments are detected and considered to be visible text, see
  [d321c1][3].
* Replies from Yahoo! which lack ">" quote indicators are handled correctly,
  see [e844d][4].
* Alternative quote headers used by gmail are handled correctly, see
  [7ecb6][5]
